# IRRBB-OptionRisk-StressTest

## Overview

This project models **Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB)** with a specific focus on **option risk**, capturing behavioral elements such as **loan prepayments** and **non-maturity deposit (NMD) withdrawals**. By applying parallel rate shocks ranging from -200 to +200 basis points, the analysis measures the impact on:

- ðŸ”º Î”NII (Change in 12-month Net Interest Income)
- ðŸ”º Î”EVE (Change in Economic Value of Equity)
-  Net Cash Position (Liquidity impact after 1 year)

The results are visualized using an interactive **Power BI** dashboard.

## Methodology

Behavioral Assumptions:
Loan Prepayment (prepayment_rate)
Modeled as Conditional Prepayment Rate (CPR)

Based on loan type, rate differential, and sensitivity

Maximum CPR capped at 30%

NMD Withdrawal (nmd_decay_rate)
Differentiates between core and non-core balances

Behavior based on deposit type, rate gap, and sensitivity

Weighted average decay rate applied per product

Stress Testing:
Interest rate shock range: -200 to +200 bps in 25 bps increments

Assumes base market rate of 4.5%
Simulates:

Year 1 interest flows (Î”NII)

Lifetime present value of flows (Î”EVE)

Net cash position after Year 1 (liquidity impact)


## Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)

Deposit and loan portfolio distribution

Weighted rates and maturities

Shock Impact Summary

Î”NII and Î”EVE under +200 and -200 bps scenarios

Gap profile showing loan/deposit mismatch over maturity buckets

Scenario Drilldown

Compare base vs. stressed scenario inputs (e.g., prepay, decay)

Track principal, interest, and cash movement over Year 1

Trend Visualization

Î”NII, Î”EVE, and Net Cash Position across all shock levels

Tabular output by component (loan/deposit behavior)
